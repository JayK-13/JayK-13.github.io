									<h3>About</h3>
									<p>The Fault In Our Stars is a 2012 young adult novel by author John Green and published by Dutton Books. It's his sixth novel and is narrated by 16-year-old cancer teen Hazel Grace. The two main characters are her and another teen cancer patient, Augustus Waters.</p>
									<p>The 2014 film "The Fault In Our Stars" was based off of this book, and was rated 7.9/10 on IMDb. The movie was met with favorable reviews, and won one of the 41st People's Choice Awards, 3 MTV Movie Awards, and all 7 Teen Choice Awards 2014 that it was nominated for. </p>
									<p>The title of the book comes from this line in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, where Cassius says to Brutus: "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,/But in ourselves, that we are underlings." Another part influenced by Shakespear was the last line of the book, "I do", symbolizes marriage because "Shakespeare's comedies end in marriage and his tragedies end in death, and I was rather fond of the idea that my book could end (symbolically, at least) in both."</p>
									<h3>Plot</h3>
									<p>WARNING: SPOILER ALERT</p>
									<p>Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year old cancer patient attends a support group because of her mother's request. During one of the support meetings, she meets a new teen, a 17-year old boy named Augustus Waters who's missing a leg because of osteosarcoma. At the meeting, they bond and give each other their favorite books. Augustus gives Hazel "The Price of Dawn", and Hazel gives "An Imperial Affliction", and Augustus expresses frustration over the novel's lack of ending. Hazel tells him the author hasn't been heard from since the publication of the book. A week later, Augustus has tracked down the author, Van Houten's, assistant, Lidewij, and has started an email correspondence with Van Houten through her. They write to Van Houten with questions regarding his novel, but he replies saying he can only answer in person. At a picnic, Hazel's surprised by Augustus with tickets to Amsterdam, where Van Houten resides. In Amsterdam, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel: “I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.” (sounds like someone's having an existential crisis). The two finally meet Van Houten but find him to be a mean drunk. Lidewij confesses to having arranged the meeting for him, resulting in Van Houten becoming angered, and insults Hazel's cancer. This sparks on argument and Hazel and Augustus run away from his home. Later on, Augustus reveals his health is deteriorating. When the return to Indianapolis, Augustus ends up in the ICU for a few days. Fearing his death, Augustus invites Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they give eulogies. Extremely sick, Augustus dies soon after. At his funeral, Van Houten shows up and apologizes to Hazel. She learns that Augustus was writing a sequel to "An Imperial Affliction", and reads what he wrote. He states that getting hurt in this world in inevitable, but we get to choose who we allow to hurt us, and that he is happy with his choice, and hopes Hazel is too. The book finally ends with Hazel saying, "I do."</p>
